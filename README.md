# Top Secret Rosies: HP Challenge

This repository contains the results I have obtained during the [TSR Challenge HP](https://topsecretrosies.soko.tech/).

The goal of the challenge was to build a system for vision impaired people that was supposed to classify images into their corresponding class (Documents, Plans or Tickets). Then, for the Tickets class, the system should be able to recognize the text, extract the important information (shop's name, address, date of the purchase and total amount) and convert this text information to speech and reproduce it out loud.

## Repository structure
The structure of the repository is pretty simple. The file `Challenge-HP.pdf` contains the requirements of the challenge, while the Jupyter Notebooks `1stPart.ipynb` and `2nd3rdPart.ipynb` contain the classification part and the text extraction and speech conversion, respectively. Both the code and the reports are presented in the form of Jupyter Notebooks.
